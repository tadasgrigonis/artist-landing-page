Landing page design. Made using Bootstrap. Although I have overwritten it so many times, that given more time I could have written my own desktop/mobile navbar toggle and not used Bootstrap at all. 
Clicking on pictures opens painting's directory by JavaScript on top of the gallery. 
Other than that just basic functionality as it was a final project in my Web Development course. 
Will be developed fully and put on Wordpress.
